      <h2>SNES Controller</h2>
      <p>
        On 01/31/2018 I was asked to make an instument for my music apperication course.
        Having little to no background in music, I decided to do what any <strike>good</strike> computer
        science student would do. Program my own instument. My professor was very kind enough to allow me
        to do so. With this assignment I made an SNES controller make different soundwaves, emulating what
        you would find on an NES. It's nothing a purist would like and with how dirty this code was written,
        id imagine people screaming that do music at this.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ill go ahead and explain the notation.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div class="center">
          <h3>Normal Notes</h3>
          <img class="musicNote3" src="buttons/LEFT.png" />
          <img class="musicNote3" src="buttons/RIGHT.png" />
          <img class="musicNote2" src="buttons/UP.png" />
          <img class="musicNote2" src="buttons/DOWN.png" />
          <br />
          <br />
          <img class="musicNote3" src="buttons/LEFT.png" />
          <img src="buttons/L.png"/>
          <img class="musicNote3" src="buttons/RIGHT.png" />
          <img src="buttons/L.png"/>
          <img class="musicNote2" src="buttons/UP.png" />
          <img src="buttons/L.png"/>
          <img class="musicNote2" src="buttons/DOWN.png" />
          <img src="buttons/L.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          The meat and potatos of this instument is done mostly with the d-pad of the controller.
          This uses whatever soundwave is selected by using <img src="buttons/SELECT.png" /> to change
          the timbre of the instument. The d-pad along used with the <img src="buttons/L.png" /> as a modifier
          makes the sound go up in pitch to reach more than just four notes. Using diagonals will make noises
          between the two sounds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="center">
          <h3>Bass Notes</h3>
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/A.png" />
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/B.png" />
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/X.png" />
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/Y.png" />
          <br />
          <br />
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/A.png" />
          <img src="buttons/R.png"/>
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/B.png" />
          <img src="buttons/R.png"/>
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/X.png" />
          <img src="buttons/R.png"/>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          The bass notes on the right side of the controller can be used in combos to make different sounds.
          For example, if you press <img src="buttons/A.png" /> and <img src="buttons/B.png"/> at the same time
          it will play a note inbetween those two notes. If you use a <img src="buttons/R.png"/> with any bass
          notes, it will make the note sound higher. Giving you a good range to work with for a bassline.
        </p>


        <div class="center">
          <h3>Snare</h3>
          <img class="musicNote" src="buttons/X.png" />
          <img src="buttons/R.png"/>
          <p>
            I was only really able to get a snare drum using a bit of whitenoise. If you cut off whitenoise
            really quickly it makes a reasonably believable snare drum sound. It's enough to make this controller
            be a one-man-band type of instument.
